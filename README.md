This repository contains data files used for analyses in Natalie deHueck's Master's thesis, "Untangling the Causes of InSAR-Derived Land Subsidence in Galveston County" (University of Texas at Austin, Energy and Earth Resources Master's program).

There are three files of hydrocarbon well production data.  The first Excel file is "Detailed Well Lease Information", which contains detailed information for each individual well lease in Galveston County, both onshore and offshore, since production began in 1958.  This file formed the basis of the second Excel file, "Entire Monthly Well History in Galveston County", where monthly production data for all historical wells in the county are recorded.  Finally, the third Excel file contains the sorted, production data for onshore wells in our three production periods of study, titled "Production data 2017-2020, 2013-2016, 1958-1969".  This Excel file is the primary file that analyses used, as it contained the active onshore wells, their corresponding land-surface deformation value, and subsurface fluid production volumes using gas conversion metrics to assess total produced fluids in barrels per month.
